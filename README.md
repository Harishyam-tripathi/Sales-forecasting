# 📈 Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project aims to forecast future sales using historical sales data. It leverages time series models and regression techniques to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Date / Time (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Sales values (numeric)
- Optional: Product categories, regions, stores, etc.

## 🧠 Objective
- Understand historical sales patterns
- Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies
- Forecast future sales using predictive models

## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Decomposition
- Feature Engineering (lag features, rolling means)
- Modeling:
  - ARIMA
  - Linear Regression
  - Facebook Prophet
  - Random Forest (optional)

## 📊 Visualizations
- Line charts of historical and predicted sales
- Seasonality plots
- Residual plots
- Forecast accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- statsmodels / Prophet

## 🚀 Output
Accurate sales forecasts with visual representation of predicted vs actual trends. Business insights on seasonality and growth patterns.
